Artificial Intelligence:
It is a branch of computer science that enables the computer to learn without the explicit programming
(instructions based programming telling the computer to carry out the certain tasks through the instructions).
Machine Learning:
Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that makes the computer learn through examples and
experiences. Model gets trained over the new data and this process is kept repeating time to time.
Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
