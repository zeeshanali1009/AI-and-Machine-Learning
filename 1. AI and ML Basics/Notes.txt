Artificial Intelligence:
"It is a branch of computer science that enables the computer to learn without the explicit programming
(instructions based programming telling the computer to carry out the certain tasks through the instructions)."

Machine Learning:
"Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that makes the computer learn through examples and
experiences. Model gets trained over the new data and this process is kept repeating time to time."

Types of Machine Learning:
----- 1. Supervised Learning    (Labelled Data)
    Types of Supervised Learning:
        a. Classification (Data with classes)
        b. Regression (Score based Answers/Feedbacks)
        Explaination
                a. Classification: 
                "Data is arranged into the classes for instance squares, triangles etc are already being classified
                 as the seperated form."
                b. Regression:
                "Score based answer for instance the output on the essay like asking the model what is your feedback
                 on the essay."

----- 2. Unsupervised Learning  (Unlabelled Data)
"A large record of data later arranged into a group or the cluster for the easy recognition and access.
It is used for the dimensionality reduction as the data with multiple inputs being given as the single output."

----- 3. Reinforcement Learning (Action Based Learning)
"Action based learning which is being carried out on the basis of the feedbacks as there are the three main
chracters in this type of learning which are agent, data , training. Agent is being trained by the use of the 
data through the process of training." For instance the child learns how to ride the bicycle like working as the 
agent in this scenario.
