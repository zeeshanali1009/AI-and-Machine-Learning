Artificial Intelligence:
"It is a branch of computer science that enables the computer to learn without the explicit programming
(instructions based programming telling the computer to carry out the certain tasks through the instructions)."

Machine Learning:
"Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that makes the computer learn through examples and
experiences. Model gets trained over the new data and this process is kept repeating time to time."

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning    (Labelled Data)
    ----Types of Supervised Learning:
        1. Classification (Data with classes)
        2. Regression (Score based Answers/Feedbacks)
        Explaination
        1. Classification: 
        "Data is arranged into the classes for instance squares, triangles etc are already being classified as the 
        seperated form."
        2. Regression:
        "Score based answer for instance the output on the essay like asking the model what is your feedback on the
        essay."

2. Unsupervised Learning  (Unlabelled Data)

3. Reinforcement Learning (Action Based Learning)
