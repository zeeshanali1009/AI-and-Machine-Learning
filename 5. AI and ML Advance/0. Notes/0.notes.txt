Artifical Intelligence:
    1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)
        like smart speakers, self driving cars, web search, AI in farming and factories.
    2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        do anything that human can do.

 Artifical Intelligence
 It is the branch of computer science concerned with development of methods that allows computer to learn without explicit programming.
 Search algorithms, rule based system, ststistical inference, machine learning.
    Machine Learning
    It is the branch of artificial intelligence that can learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard-coded rules and make predictions on new data.
    svm, tree algorithms, nearest neighbors, bagging, boosting, deep learning.
        Deep Learning
        It is the subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks (inspired from biological neurons) to deveelop learning models.
        fcns, cnns, rnns, transformers, autoencoders, gans

Samples and datapoints are the same terminologies.
Neuron:
Neuron is the most fundamntal part of the deep learning which contains the three basic things: input interconnections and the output.
Neuron is basically a function that performs a specific function.
Neurons need great:
data
computational power
well trained algorithms

Artificial intelligence is distributed into two parts
1. Descriminative (Creates the patterns, descriminate the data, make the seperations, involes the conventional models that deals with structured data better)
    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised learning
    3. Reinforcement learning
2. Generative (generates the information can deal with both structured and unstructured data as well)
    1. NLP(Natural Language Processing)
        It deals with the natural language with the text and with the neurons that deals with this sort of data.
    2. Speech Recognition
        It deals with the speech,voice related data.
    3. Computer Vision
        it deals with the images, videoes.
