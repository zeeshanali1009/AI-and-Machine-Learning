Artifical Intelligence:
    1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)
        like smart speakers, self driving cars, web search, AI in farming and factories.
    2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        do anything that human can do.

 Artifical Intelligence
 It is the branch of computer science concerned with development of methods that allows computer to learn without explicit programming.
 Search algorithms, rule based system, ststistical inference, machine learning.
    Machine Learning
    It is the branch of artificial intelligence that can learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard-coded rules and make predictions on new data.
    svm, tree algorithms, nearest neighbors, bagging, boosting, deep learning.
        Deep Learning
        It is the subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks (inspired from biological neurons) to deveelop learning models.
