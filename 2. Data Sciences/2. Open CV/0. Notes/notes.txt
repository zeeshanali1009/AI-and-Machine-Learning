Introduction
OpenCV (Open Computer Vision):
It is the computer vision library in the python.
Life before openCv:
1. Coding difficulty (more and complex code was required)
2. Performance Issues (hence more code was there so more processing power was required)
3. Lack of standardization (there was no standard set for the common practice, so everyone had its own standard)
Solution for these problems:
1. Easy to use functions (relative functions are there to solve the particular problems)
2. Lightening fast problem (every process started to process fastly)
3. open source standard (everyone can access the open standard)

In 1999, OpenCV was built adn launched in 2000. It was released in Intel 

OpenCV:
Open means free source.
Computer includes laptop, phone, robot, drone, self,driving cars
Vision includes images, videoes, objects, faces, motion, documents, barcodes, number plates 
It is like a tool box that helps the computer to see enables the computer for the vision.

OpenCV Basics and Image Handling 
Following are the key terms involved into the image handling:
Image: Image is the matrix that has the pixls in the form of rows and coloumns.
Pixel:It is the smallest unit in the picture.
Width and Height: Number of pixels present in the pictures in the form of width and height.
Color Channels: Color channels involves the gray gradinet and rgb 
Image Format: It is the format of the image in which the image gets stored such as jpg,png etc

Functions:
1. imread() invloves flag that tells the compiler in which color mode to load the file
2. imshow()
    waitkey()
    destroyallwindows()
3. imwrite()
4. cvtcolor()
5. image.shape
    gives height, width, channel      channel provides the information for the pixel that how many colors it has 3 in rgb , 
    1 in grayscale  and 4 color transparency

Image Transformation and Manipulation Techniques
1. Resizing and Scaling
    resize()
2. Cropping
    slicing
3. Drawing shapes
    lines
    rectangles
    circle
4. Rotation and Flipping
    Rotation
    flipping
5. Adding Text
    Text placement
    font selection

Working with Video and Webcam
Video Processing Workflow involves the following steps:
-Capture the videoes
-process frames 
-save the video

Video Components:
Video:
video is just the collection of images which are being dispayed at the very fast speed.every image is a frame 
(usually every secong 30 to 60 frames ar being showed)
Webcam:
The camera which is present on the laptop or computers.
Frame by frame processing:
Frame is a photo which is the part of the chain of the videos.
In frame processing every single detection is carried out using the specific frames , hence the frames collectively 
forms a video.
used for detection,analyze
two function will be discussed
videocapture()
vieowriter()

Image filtering and Blurring
On raw image we apply 
guassian Blurring
median Blurringsharpening image 
so the image will become the enhanced image
Image Filtering:
changing the pixel (applying the functions on the pixel) depending upon the other pixel.
Blurring:
Softening the image so that it looks less sharp.
Noise :
unnecessary things on the image like the dots
Smoothing:
making sharp and rough areas clean.
kernel:

Image Filtering:
        Blurring, Noise , Smoothing , kernel
Blurring:
        Guassian blur, median blur, biletral blur, mormal blur
