Introduction
OpenCV (Open Computer Vision):
It is the computer vision library in the python.
Life before openCv:
1. Coding difficulty (more and complex code was required)
2. Performance Issues (hence more code was there so more processing power was required)
3. Lack of standardization (there was no standard set for the common practice, so everyone had its own standard)
Solution for these problems:
1. Easy to use functions (relative functions are there to solve the particular problems)
2. Lightening fast problem (every process started to process fastly)
3. open source standard (everyone can access the open standard)

In 1999, OpenCV was built adn launched in 2000. It was released in Intel 

OpenCV:
Open means free source.
Computer includes laptop, phone, robot, drone, self,driving cars
Vision includes images, videoes, objects, faces, motion, documents, barcodes, number plates 
It is like a tool box that helps the computer to see enables the computer for the vision.

OpenCV Basics and Image Handling 
Following are the key terms involved into the image handling:
Image: Image is the matrix that has the pixls in the form of rows and coloumns.
Pixel:It is the smallest unit in the picture.
Width and Height: Number of pixels present in the pictures in the form of width and height.
Color Channels: Color channels involves the gray gradinet and rgb 
Image Format: It is the format of the image in which the image gets stored such as jpg,png etc

Functions:
1. imread()
2. imshow()
    waitkey()
    destroyallwindows()
3. imwrite()
4. cvtcolor()
5. image.shape
    gives height, width, channel
