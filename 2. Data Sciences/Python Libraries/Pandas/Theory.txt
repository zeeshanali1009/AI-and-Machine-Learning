 1. Data manipulation:
Data manipulation means changing or organizing the data and make it usefull for the particular requirement.
for example: In a general store organizing the store items like fruits, vegetables etc seperately.

2. Data Analysis
Data analysis means analyzig the complete data and then extracting some sort of insights from the existing data.
for example: Analyzing the student record for getting the record of the student getting the highest or lowest marks

Key Differences:
Data manipulation:  preparing and cleaing the data, organize and structure the raw data, 
like fixing the student grade sheet

like analyzing which student have got the highest marks 



What is Pandas?
Pandas is a powerful and popular python library used for the data manipulation(cleaning, transforming and structuring data) and 
data analysis (finding patterns, spreadsheets or time-series data) 

Features:
works seamlessly with structured data formats like CSV and excel 
handles the missing values easily
built on numpy for fast computations

Why use Pandas?
Performance (can handles millions of rows efficiently)
Ease of Use (Beginner friendly syntax)
Integration (works with ther libraries like Matplotlib(visualization) and Sickit learn)


Use/ Application
Finance  (Time series data or stocks data)
Retails (store related data) 
HealthCare (many and much healthcare related data)


Series:
A series is a one-dimensional labelled array that can hold any type of data like integers, float, strings or even python objects
Each element in the series has a unique label called an index
It is often used to track the changes over time such as daily temperatures, stock prices or sales revenue

Dataframe:
A dataframe is a two dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in a dataset, an excel spreadsheet or a SQL
table. It consists of rows and coloumns where 
Rows have Indices  (labels)
Coloumns haver names   (labels)
