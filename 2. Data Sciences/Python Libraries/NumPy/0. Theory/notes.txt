Numpy(Numerical Python) is the important python library used for the heavy calculations on the data at once.
Normally Python lists cannot carry out the major calculations very fast so that we have to adopt some new methods
and the patern so that the things must get very much easier.
Features of Numpy:
-Fast with high speed                   
-takes less memory for the operations to be carry out                                       
-Easy math operations
-Very important in AI/ML
