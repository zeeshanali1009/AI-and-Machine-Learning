This python liobrary is basically used to convert the data into the visual form.

Data Visualization:
Representing the data into the visual form for the better understanding of the Data.
Turning boring data (tables etc) into the meaningful form of data.
"Pictures speak louder then the words."

These are the data visualization libraries used particularly:
Matplotlib                  Seaborn                 Plotly              Pandas(Plot)                Bookeh
Basic & Powerful            Statistical Plots       Interactive         Quick Plots                 Interactive and
                            on Matplotlib           Web based                                       easy one

Advantages of the data visualization:
-Saves time                          -Easy Communication                  -Spot trends and patterns
-Better decision making              -Handles big data aswell

Important Points:
1. Human brain processes the images 60000 times faster then the other form of data like text or tables etc 
2. Visualization can make lies. Charts or tables can also present the lies.
3. 90% big data projects fail because the early data visualization is not easy.
4. Human brain can hold 7 Pcs data at once.

Chart types:
1. Line graph                       4. Bar chart 
2. Pie Chart                        5. Histogram
3. Scatter Plot                     6. Custom Graphics
