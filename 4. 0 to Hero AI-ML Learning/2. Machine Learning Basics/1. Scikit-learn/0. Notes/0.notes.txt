TensorFlow:
It ia an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It's a designed for building and 
deploying machine learning models with a focus on deep learning applications.
Developed originally for large numercial alculations.
Accepts the data in the form of multidimensional arrays of higher dimensions called tensors.
Works on the basis of data flow graphs that have nodes and edges.

Tensors:
Tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices of potentially highr dimensions. Array of data with different dimensions 
and ranks that are fed as input to the neural network are called tensors.
Data in the form of arrays is fed as input to the network.
Tensors exists in the from of different dimenssions like [1], [2,2], [3,3,3]
Tensor Ranks:
Rank 0
s=[200]
Rank 1
v= [10,11,12]
Rank 2
t  =[[[1],[2],[3]],[[4],[5],[6]],[[7],[8],[9]]]
Rank 3
m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6]
Data flow graphs:
Each computation in tensorflow is represented as a data flow graph.
Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation (add,subtract,multiply) and each edge represents multidimensional array.
Comuptataional graph is the graph of programming logic which tensorflow builds in the memory.
It enables creating large scale neural networks as computing can be distributed across several CPU's and GPU's.
Program Elements in tensorflow:
1. Constants:
constants are parameters whose values does not change. to define a constant we use tf.constant() command.
2. Variable:
They allow us to add new trainable parameters to graph. To define a variable we use tf.variable() command and initilize them before running the 
graph in a session.
3. Placeholder:
They allow us to feed data to a tensorflow model from outside a model. it permits a value to be assigned later.to define the placeholder we use tf.placeholder().
4. Session:
A session  is run to evaluate the nodes. This is also called as the tensorflow runtime.it is launched using the command tf.session().

Advanatages:
1. Versatile & Flexibility
        Supports a wide array of algorithms and is adaptable for a variety of tasks.
2. Ecosysystem & Tools 
        It provides a rich ecosystem of tools that helps researchers and developers to build and deploy ML models.
3. Community & Support
        Community provides excellent support through tutorials, forums and github discussions.

Why tensor flows
1. provides both c++ and python api's that makes it easier to work upon.
2. has a faster compilation time than other deep learning libraries like keras and torch.
3. tensorflow supports both CPU's and GPU's computing devices.


One hot encoding:
It is a technique to convert the categorical values into binary vecotor representations.tensorflow provides this feature.


Deep Learning:
Deep learning is the subset of the machine learning in which we have to extract the features manually but in the deep learnig 
this process is carried out automatically from the raw data which is possible due to the neural networls that contains the multiple
layers that performs specific functions at each level.
Type of Deep Learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning



Artificial Neural Network:
ANNs are inspired by the structure and function of human neurons, consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, or units.
They contan three parts :
Input layers            Hidden Layers           Output Layers 

Types of Neural Network 
1. Feedforward Neural Network (FNNs):
Simplest types of neural networks where information flows linearly from the input to the output.
It is used in the tasks like image classification, speech recognition and NLP.
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNNS):
CNNs are ideal for the image classification, object detection and image detection due to their automatic feature learning from the images.
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
RNNs are specialized for the preprocessing sequential data like time series and natural language.
