Introduction
OpenCV (Open Computer Vision):
It is the computer vision library in the python.
Life before openCv:
1. Coding difficulty (more and complex code was required)
2. Performance Issues (hence more code was there so more processing power was required)
3. Lack of standardization (there was no standard set for the common practice, so everyone had its own standard)
Solution for these problems:
1. Easy to use functions (relative functions are there to solve the particular problems)
2. Lightening fast problem (every process started to process fastly)
3. open source standard (everyone can access the open standard)

In 1999, OpenCV was built adn launched in 2000. It was released in Intel 

OpenCV:
Open means free source.
Computer includes laptop, phone, robot, drone, self,driving cars
Vision includes images, videoes, objects, faces, motion, documents, barcodes, number plates 
It is like a tool box that helps the computer to see enables the computer for the vision.
