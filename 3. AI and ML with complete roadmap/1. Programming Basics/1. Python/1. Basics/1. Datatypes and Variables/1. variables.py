# Variables are like the containers which are used to store the data into them. this data can be of variety of forms and the specific 
# form or type of the data is stored into the specific or relevant container or variable 
number = 34
name =  "zeeshan"

# here it is evident that the containers are used to store the data into them whatever the datatype is. Actualy the python automatically 
# detects the datatype of the variable by looking into the data which is stored into the variables. 
# but if you can add the manual datatype into the variables this can be done as 

number: int  = 34
name: str  =  "zeeshan"
