Database Management System involves two architectures:
1. Two-tier Architecture.
2. Three-tier Architecture.
Explaination:
1. Two Tier Architecture:
It involves the twl layers which are as:  Client Layer          Data Layer(Database)
Clients are associated with the client layer while the data is present in the database and is usually accessed directly. Any query performed by the client is processed into the 
database directly and output is given directly to the user.
Pros and Cons
It is maintaind very easily as there are only two layers to maintained.
cannot bear the load of more clients
Has more security vulnerabilities because database layer is accessed directly.
It is not much scalable.
Example:
Railway station systems


2. Three-Tier Architecture:
It involves the two layers which are as:  Client Layer          Application/Business Layer          Data Layer(Database)
Clients are associated with the client layer while the data is present in the database and is usually accessed through an intermediate/application/business layer. Any query performed
by the client is processed into the business layer data is also been accessed through the business layer.
Pros and Cons:
It is very hard to maintain it as there are more layers as comapred to other architectures.
It is very secured as compared to other architecture as there is the intermediate layer as well.
It can bear the load of more users as well.
Examples :
Enterprises system where more security is required.
