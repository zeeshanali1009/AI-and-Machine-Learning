These are the following types of the keys:
1. Super Keys
2. Candidate Keys
3. Primary Keys
4. Foreign Keys
5. Composite and Compound Keys
6. Alternate Keys
7. Surrogate Keys
Explaination:
Suppose we have a table 
SID                  regid                  SName                  SBranch                 SEmail
1                    1-1-1-1                ali                    Cs                      ali@gmail.com
2                    2-2-2-2                tom                    se                      tom@gmail.com
3                    3-3-3-3                doe                    it                      doe@gmail.com
4                    4-4-4-4                Own                    Cs                      Own@gmail.com
5                    5-5-5-5                Raza                   it                      Raza@gmail.com
Super Keys:
Super keys is the key which we just understood in the beginning. All the keys are the super keys in the beginning.
An attribute or a set of attributes that can be used to identify row of data in a table is a super key.
For example:
sid,sname, sbranch 
combinations would be like :
sid+regid  regid+email   email+sid   sid+regid+email

Candidate Key:
it is the minimal subset of super key.
If any proper subset of a super key is a super key then that key cannot be a candidate key.
Example;
like we have the super key "sid+regid+email" from which a super key already exists "regid+email" which is a combination
like "regid+email" is a cobinational super key and have minimal super keys like "regid", "email" so these are the candidate keys.
sid,sname, sbranch are the candidate keys.

Primary Key:
The candidate key choosen to uniquely identify each row of data in a table.
No two rows can have the same primary key value.
Pprimary key value annot be a null.
Every row must have the primary key.
Example:
regid is the priamry key in tha above example

Alternate Keys:
All the other keys except the primary keys are the alternate keys.
Example:
regid is the primary key so sname, sbranch, semail are the alternate keys.

Foreign Keys:
Foreign key establishes the relationship between one table to another table:
we have already a table 
SID                  regid                  SName                  SBranch                 SEmail
1                    1-1-1-1                ali                    Cs                      ali@gmail.com
2                    2-2-2-2                tom                    se                      tom@gmail.com
3                    3-3-3-3                doe                    it                      doe@gmail.com
4                    4-4-4-4                Own                    Cs                      Own@gmail.com
5                    5-5-5-5                Raza                   it                      Raza@gmail.com

and another table exists like 

Branch Code                 BranchName                   HOD
Cs                          Computer Science             Asad ali
IT                          Information Technology       Gohar Mumtaz
SE                          Software Engineerin          Muhammad Ali
Cs                          Computer Science             Asad ali
Here "branch code" is the foreign key.
we cannot add/update/delete the one table foreign key row without doing it with the other table rows

Composite Keys:
Any key with more then one attribute is called the attribute key.
for example: 
combinations would be like :
sid+regid  regid+email   email+sid   sid+regid+email        email+sbranch


Compound Key:
If a composite key has at-least one attribute which is a foreign key then it is called the compound key.
for example:
email+sbranch
