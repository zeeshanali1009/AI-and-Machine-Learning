Entity relationship Diagram:
ER diagram represents the relationships of the entities that need to be stored in the database.
ER diagram is a structural design that represents the relationships among the entities of the database.
ER diagram is mainly built on the three components which are entities, attributes and relationships

Significance of ERD:
Heps us to conceptualize the database.
Gives us the better understanding of the data.
Reduces the complexity and saves the time as well.
Helps us to describe elements

Symbols:
Rectangle--------------------------------> Entity
Oval-------------------------------------> Attribute 
Double Rectangle-------------------------> Weak Entity
lined Oval-------------------------------> Derived Attribute
Diamond----------------------------------> Relationship
Double Oval------------------------------> Multivalued Attribute

Components:
Entity                              Attribute                   Relationship
Weak Entity                         Keys                        One to many
                                    Composite                   One to many
                                    Multivalued                 Many to one 
                                    Derived                     Many to one

Entity:
An entity can be either a living or a non-living component usually showcased in a rectangle.
like Doctors, Nurses 
Weak entity usually relies over another entity usually showcased in the double rectangle.

Attribute:
An attribute descibes the property of an entity.
Types of Attribute:
Key attribute uniquely identifies the entity from other entity set like ids in the diagram.
Composite attribute is composed of other attributes like first, middle, last form name.
Multivalued attribute can possess more then one value like gender can have more then one value.
Derived attribute is extracted from other attributes like head doctor id in the diagram.

Relationships:
It shows the relationships between the entities showcased in the diamond.
Types of relationships:
One to One Relationship: When single element of an entity is associated with a single element of another entity.
One to Many Relationship: When single element of an entity is associated with a more then single element of another entity.
Many to One Relationship: When more then single element of an entity is associated with a single element of another entity.
One to Many Relationship: When more then single element of an entity is associated with a more then single element of another entity.

Key Points to draw the erd diagram:
First identify the all entities embed them into the rectangle.
Identify the relationships between entities and connect them using the diamond.
Connect attributes for entities and label them properly.
Eradicate any redundant entities or relationships.
Make sure your ERD diagram supports all the data provided to design the database.


Cardinality:
In mathematics:
Cardinality = number of elements in a set.
Example: {2, 4, 6} has a cardinality of 3.

In databases it has two contexts:

1. Column Cardinality:
Describes how unique the data is in a column.
High cardinality → Many unique values.
Example: Email column (almost all rows different).
Low cardinality → Few unique values.
Example: Gender column (mostly "Male" or "Female").

Relationship Cardinality (ER Diagrams)
Describes the number of instances of one entity that relate to another entity.
Common types:
One-to-One (1:1) → One student has exactly one ID card.
One-to-Many (1:N) → One teacher can teach many students.
Many-to-Many (M:N) → Many students can enroll in many courses
